    <h1>test-master</h1>

    <div class="description">
      <em>test-master</em> is a local-only test setup for the elmo build
      infrastructure.
    </div>

    <h2>Take-Aways</h2>
    <p>This document explains a complete local setup of an elmo test
      environment. You'll see how to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure <code>master-ball/test-master</code></li>
      <li>Create staging environment</li>
      <li>Run mercurial webserver</li>
      <li>Set up elmo</li>
      <li>Set up the master</li>
      <li>Set up the slave</li>
      <li>Run the bots</li>
      <li>Watch the results</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">
      <p>There are going to be several shell terminals and
      virtualenvs throughout this page. In each command, the shell prompt
      indicates the activated virtualenv, if so, and the directory you should be
      in. That is, a</p>
      <pre><code class="env master-ball">ls</code></pre>
      <p>is a <code>ls</code> in the <code>master-ball</code> directory with the
      <code>@master</code> virtualenv activated.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="configure">Install and Configure test-master</h2>
    <p>
      For the general master setup, you want to follow the instructions
      for l10n-master, but you'll put your local.py into the
      <code>test-master</code>
      directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your
      <code>test-master/local.py</code>
      should look somewhat like this:
    </p>
    <pre>from base_settings import *
DATABASES = {
    'default': {} # you know this stuff
}
REPOSITORY_BASE = '/tmp/stage/repos/'
buildbase = '/tmp/builds/'
</pre>
    <p>
      The
      <code>REPOSITORY_BASE</code>
      points to the
      <code>repos</code>
      subdirectory in your test environment, and
      <code>buildbase</code>
      is where buildbot will store logs and other build data. We'll use
      the same directories when in
      <code>settings/mounts_local.py</code>
      when setting up elmo.
    </p>

    <h2 id="stage">Staging Environment</h2>
    <p>
      The staging environment is the area where you will do your
      mercurial work. The
      <code>repos</code>
      subdirectory holds all your <em>upstream</em> mercurial
      repostories. There's a
      <code>webdir.conf</code>
      next to it that you can use together with hg serve, and that will
      build your mercurial server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parallel to that, there's the
      <code>workdir</code>
      tree, in which you will do the actual edits to the mercurial
      server, before you commit and push them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both directory trees consist of a
      <code>l10n</code>
      directory to hold the localizations, and a
      <code>mozilla</code>
      directory for the en-US app.
    </p>
    <p>Sounds all really complicated, but there's help.</p>
    <p>For the stage setup, you just want to run</p>
    <pre><code class="no-env master-ball">python scripts/create-test-env.py $HOME/stage</code></pre>
    <p>This script does a few things:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>create a virtualenv in <code>@master</code></li>
      <li>install the requirements.txt in that env</li>
      <li>upload our hg server infrastructure into that env</li>
      <li>create the stage:
        <ul>
          <li>upstream <code>repos</code></li>
          <li>set up <code>workdir</code></li>
          <li>fill workdir with sample application in <code>mozilla</code>
            and push that
          </li>
          <li>fill in dummy localizations in <code>l10n</code>, not
            pushed
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Running the hg server</h3>
    <p>
      You'll find a
      <code>webdir.conf</code>
      in your staging area, that's the best to use to run the webserver.
      First, though, you'll want to activate your virtualenv, as that's
      picking the required version of hg.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="no-env master-ball">. \@master/bin/activate</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now head to your stage area, and start the mercurial server, on
      port
      <code>8001</code>
      . If you want to use a different port, you can do that, but you'll
      need to tweak the database objects in elmo below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="env stage">hg serve --webdir-conf=webdir.conf -p 8001</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can verify that your webserver is set up right by going to <a
        href="http://localhost:8001/">the main page</a>, and in
      particular to <a href="http://localhost:8001/mozilla/pushloghtml">mozilla's
        pushlog</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Elmo Setup</h2>
    <p>
      You wanna do a regular <a
        href="https://github.com/mozilla/elmo/wiki/Running-locally">local
        elmo setup</a>. The only interesting detail is that you also want to
      load an additional fixture. That's going to set up the
      <code>mozilla</code>
      repository and the
      <code>l10n</code>
      forrest. You'll need those for the staging area to work. The
      fixtures assume that you'll have the hg server running on
      <code>http://localhost:8001/</code>
      , so if you choose differently, you'll need to tweak that.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="elmo">./manage.py loaddata localhost</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will find any file called
      <code>localhost.json</code>
      in any of the installed apps and install it.
    </p>

    <h2>Master setup</h2>
    <p>As you're in a new shell now, you want to activate your
      virtualenv again.</p>
    <pre><code class="no-env master-ball">. @master/bin/activate</code></pre>
    <p>
      For the stuff that follows, you should generally have that on.
      You'll see by the
      <code>(@master)</code>
      prefix in the code snippets which lines are in the env for sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're working in
      <code>test-master</code>
      , so let's go there, and create the master.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="env master-ball">cd test-master</code>
<code class="env test-master">../scripts/buildbot create-master .</code></pre>
    <p>
      You only need to do that once. Next we need the
      <code>local.py</code>
      with the following contents, plus your common database setup:
    </p>
    <pre>from base_settings import *
DATABASES = {
    'default': {} # you know this stuff
}
REPOSITORY_BASE = '/tmp/stage/repos/'
buildbase = '/tmp/builds/</pre>
    <p>
      That's all. Next you want to set up a buildbot slave, with
      <code>slave-ball</code>
      . You want to set that up with name and password from
      <code>slaves.json</code>
      .
    </p>

    <h2>Running the bots</h2>
    <p class="note">
      The first time you run the bots, you may want to run the
      <code>get-pushes</code>
      daemon before the build bots. Usually, it's the last bot to start,
      though.<br> This is to get the initial push to
      <code>en-US</code>
      into the database without triggering a build for it, which is
      closer to what happens in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 5 services involved in running the dashboard, the <a
        href="#mercurial">mercurial web server</a>, the <a href="#elmo">elmo
        webserver</a>, the buildbot <a href="#master">master</a> and <a
        href="#slave">slave</a>, and the twistd <a href="#get-pushes">get-pushes</a>
      daemon. You always want to have your mercurial server up. The elmo
      server can be up or not, it doesn't interfere with the other bots.
      It's just good to be there to check that the rest reports as
      expected. The three remaining bots are the actual build system,
      and the starting order of those has actual impact on what happens.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mercurial">mercurial web server</h3>
    <p>Before you start the build automation, be sure that the
      mercurial webserver is running.</p>
    <pre><code class="env stage">hg serve --webdir-conf=webdir.conf -p 8001</code></pre>
    <p>The master and slave both need each other to get any work
      done. The order of startup isn't really important, as the slave
      continuously try to connect to the master. When they don't reach
      the master, they back up, though. The quickest startup time is to
      start the master first, and then the slave.</p>
    <h3 id="master">buildbot master</h3>
    <p>
      In the
      <code>master-ball</code>
      directory, do
    </p>
    <pre><code class="env master-ball">./scripts/buildbot start test-master</code>
<code class="env master-ball">tail -f test-master/twistd.log</code></pre>
    <p>
      where
      <code>test-master</code>
      is the path to the test-master directory, not the name or
      something else.
    </p>
    <p>You'll already see a bit of work in the log, as the master
      gets itself ready to get crackin'. But for the actual work, it
      needs the slave(s).</p>
    <h3 id="slave">buildbot slave</h3>
    <p>
      In the virtualenv of
      <code>slave-ball</code>
      and that directory, run
    </p>
    <pre><code class="env slave-ball">./scripts/buildbot start slave</code>
<code class="env slave-ball">tail -f slave/twistd.log</code></pre>
    <p>
      You want to make sure that the bots do the right thing up to here,
      in particular that the <a href="#master-started">startup
        builds are successful</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First bot you want to run is the pushlog poller, which copies the
      pushlog databases from your
      <code>repos</code>
      into elmo. You probably want to do this <em>before</em> you start
      the buildbot master, just because it's more realistic to have
      repos first, and then builds.
    </p>
    <h3 id="get-pushes">get-pushes</h3>
    <p>
      You'll want to run this from
      <code>master-ball/</code>
      directory.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="env master-ball">PYTHONPATH=$PWD/test-master twistd get-pushes -s settings_master -n</code>
<code class="env master-ball">tail -f twistd.log</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now you're looking at the log file of the get-pushes daemon. If you're
      running it for the first time, you should find a push on
      <code>mozilla</code> , and then cycle every few seconds.
    </p>

    <h3 id="elmo">elmo</h3>
    <p>
      Last but not least, you want to run the elmo webserver, too. If
      you're using a virtualenv for elmo, us that. We'll assume the
      default port here and going forward,
      <code>8000</code>
      .
    </p>
    <pre><code class="elmo">./manage.py runserver</code></pre>

    <h2>Watch the results</h2>
    <p>You should have 5 shells with logs for each part of the
      automation now:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the django log for elmo</li>
      <li>the hg output of hg serve (noisy, that's cool)</li>
      <li>the tail of twistd.log for get-pushes (this makes hg
        noisy)</li>
      <li>the tail of twistd.log for test-master</li>
      <li>the tail of twistd.log for the slave connected to
        test-master</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Expectations on elmo</h3>
    <p>
      On elmo, the <a href="http://localhost:8000/">homepage</a> should
      show 4 active l10n repositories, and the pushes view over <a
        href="http://localhost:8000/pushes/">all repositories</a> should
      show one push on the
      <code>mozilla</code>
      repository.
    </p>
    <p id="master-started">
      Whenever you start the buildmaster, it will trigger a build per <em>tree</em>
      to get more data from the
      <code>l10n.ini</code>
      files on hg, and as you started all bots, you should see one build
      on the <a href="http://localhost:8000/builds/waterfall">waterfall</a>,
      for the <em>tree-builder</em> Builder. If that box isn't green,
      your setup is broken. From there, you get to the actual <a
        href="http://localhost:8000/builds/builders/tree-builder/0">build
        display</a>, showing one step
      <code>configured fx</code>
      . You should be able to surf to it's
      <code>stdio</code>
      log, and see the build properties. In particular the
      <code>locales</code>
      and
      <code>tree</code>
      build properties should match your setup.
    </p>

    <h2>Play</h2>
    <p>
      Next up is play. Let's be a localizer and push our changes. The
      staging script already pre-filled all working copies with data,
      which we can now just push. While we're doing that, watching the <a
        href="http://localhost:8000/builds/tbpl">TBPL</a> (bad name) is
      entertaining. (That page only refreshes every 5 minutes, tweak
      <code>delay</code>
      in a js shell for now.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's go to our working directories,
      <code>l10n/ab</code>
      for a start, and push. Be sure to have your virtualenv activated
      again.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="env stage">cd workdir/l10n/ab</code>
<code class="env stage-ab">hg push</code></pre>
    <p>That will tell you that it's inserting that changeset to the
      pushlog. That's the local one per repository that our mercurial
      hooks do.</p>
    <p>
      Next, the
      <code>get-pushes</code>
      daemon will find that, and add it to the overall elmo pushes
      database. You can verify that on the <a
        href="http://localhost:8000/pushes/">pushes</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the
      <code>test-master</code>
      will pick that up, and schedule a compare-locales build for it,
      which then runs and does the work on the slave.
    </p>
    <p>As the build starts (and when it's ended), it will show up on
      the build reporting page.</p>
    <p>
      Now that we have a real active tree, you'll see the
      <code>fx</code>
      tree show up on the <a href="http://localhost:8000/">homepage</a>,
      linking to the <a href="http://localhost:8000/dashboard/?tree=fx">dashboard</a>
      of the tree. Which gives us a chance to verify that the rich
      compare-locales output works as well, if you click on the
      <code>C</code>
      link there.
    </p>

    <h3>Next steps</h3>
    <p>
      Next up, you can push the remaining localizations, and also do an
      edit to the l10n files in
      <code>mozilla</code>
      , check that in and push, to see how the build system behaves if
      en-US changes. Tip: It should update all locales.
    </p>

    <h2>Shutting down</h2>
    <p>Enough learning, let's shut the bots down in a safe order:</p>
    <p>First, stop taking new pushes into our system, and kill</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>get-pushes</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre><code class="env master-ball">kill `cat twistd.pid`</code></pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Make sure that master and slave are idle, i.e., the logs only show pings,
    and then stop master and slave. The order doesn't matter much at this
    point.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>slave</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre><code class="env slave-ball">./scripts/buildbot stop slave</code></pre>
      </dd>
      <dt>master</dt>
      <dd>
        <pre><code class="env master-ball">./scripts/buildbot stop test-master</code></pre>
      </dd>
    </dl>
